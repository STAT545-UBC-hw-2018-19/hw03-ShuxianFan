# STAT545 hw03-Shuxian Fan Depository

This is the GitHub depository of Shuxian Fan for the [homework03](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw03/hw03.html) of STAT545A.

The goal is to Use `dplyr`/`ggplot2` to manipulate and explore data. 

Here are the links for the corresponding files:

## _For the peer reviewer_: 

Please take a look at the html file where I explored some features of kableExtra, which can be viewed only in the html document. You might found this message:

> (Sorry about that, but we canâ€™t show files that are this big right now.)

This is because the size of the file I generated is too large for GitHub to enable preview.

You could preview the HTML page [HERE](https://cdn.rawgit.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw03-ShuxianFan/master/hw03_gapminder.html)

OR: 

Here is a guideline of how you can download and view my work:

(1) Go to the html preview page, where you will find the message above.

(2) Right click the Download button on the up right corner

(3) Select "Download Linked File"

(4) Change the file suffix to .html (you might find the downloaded file ends with .txt)

(5) Open the downloaded file and view my work! :wink:

For your convenience :wink:, here you can find the [peer review](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/peer-review.html) page and the [assignments page](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/) which stores the general evaluation rubrics.
